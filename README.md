# NPC Transmogrifier

This patcher is supposed to randomize NPC facemorphs. After running it, you need to either regenerate FaceGen in the CK, or have Face Discoloration Fix installed. This will interfere with custom face sculpt NPCs.

This patcher is created by request and immediately placed for adoption on the Synthesis Collective. I will not be providing support to users.
